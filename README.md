# SnipeNS - The ENS Domain Sniping Tool

SnipeNS is a powerful tool for finding and acquiring valuable, recently expired Ethereum Name Service (ENS) domains. It provides real-time data on domains that are in their grace or decay periods and allows users to "snipe" them at the optimal price.

## Core Features

*   **Expired Domain Lists:** View a live list of all `.eth` domains that have recently expired. The list clearly distinguishes between domains in their 90-day **grace period** (only renewable by the original owner) and those in the 28-day **decay period** (live auction).
*   **Price-Targeted Sniping (In Development):** Instead of just trying to be the first to register, SnipeNS will allow you to set a target price. An automated bot will monitor the domain's price as it decreases along the decay curve and execute the registration transaction the moment your target price is met.
*   **Trending Domains (In Development):** A "Most Wanted" page will use a variety of metrics (user interest, domain length, dictionary words) to surface the most valuable and sought-after domains.
